* PlumHTML
org-export backend for sane HTML. Basically some changes and
extensions to [[https://github.com/balddotcat/ox-slimhtml][ox-slimhtml]]. 

Used to publish words I write.
** Installation
You want to clone the repo, cd to it then do ~M-x package-install-file
ox-plumhtml.el~
** Functions
*** ~ox-plumhtml-export-as-html~
Makes a temporary buffer with the exported HTML.
*** ~ox-plumhtml-export-to-html~
Like ~ox-plumhtml-export-as-html~ but dumps the exported HTML to a
file like =example.org= -> =example.html=
*** ~ox-plumhtml-publish-to-html~
Same as ~ox-plumhtml-export-as-html~ but for ~org-publish~
** Tests
I stole them from =ox-slimhtml= lole

      -l ert \
      -l ox-plumhtml-tests.el \
      -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
